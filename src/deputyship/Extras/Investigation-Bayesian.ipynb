    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN)** can be a useful method for capturing the drivers of step reduction in investigation demands for different case subtypes (Health & Welfare (HW) and Property & Finance (PFA)) in an aged population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why DBN?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Capturing Temporal Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigation demand trends change over time (pre- and post-pandemic), and DBNs model such dependencies explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reduction is due to shifts in operational policies, demographic changes, or other external factors, a DBN can model these temporal influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Multi-Variable Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "A DBN can incorporate multiple columns (features) such as age distributions, case types, policy changes, and external factors to identify the most influential variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows for capturing conditional dependencies between features, e.g., whether a change in triage policy has impacted HW vs. PFA cases differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differentiating Effects Across Case Subtypes\n",
    "\n",
    "HW and PFA cases may be influenced by different sets of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DBN can structure dependencies separately for each case type and analyse whether certain age groups (e.g., older individuals) are more affected in HW vs. PFA cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Causal Insights vs. Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard time series models or correlation-based analysis, DBNs allow for causal interpretation by structuring the relationships between observed variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you suspect changes in demand are driven by a policy intervention (e.g., triage removal) or pandemic effects, a DBN can help quantify their impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Data and Probabilistic Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "DBNs handle missing data well using probabilistic inference, which is useful when dealing with incomplete historical records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Define Key Variables (Columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "Age groups, case subtype (HW/PFA), investigation demand, policy changes, external socioeconomic factors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure the DBN\n",
    "\n",
    "Define temporal connections (pre/post-pandemic time steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model case subtype dependencies separately to identify diverging patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inference & Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Use methods like Expectation-Maximization (EM) or Bayesian Inference to estimate probabilities and validate findings against historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "If interpretability and robustness are priorities, you might also consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Causal Discovery (e.g., Granger Causality, DoWhy, Causal Graphs)\n",
    "- Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)\n",

    "### 3. Learning & Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to estimate the structure and parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learn from Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use structure learning algorithms (e.g., Hill Climbing, Greedy Search, PC Algorithm) to determine dependencies.\n",
    "- Train the model using Expectation-Maximization (EM) to handle missing data.\n",
    "- Use Bayesian inference (e.g., Junction Tree Algorithm) to compute probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manual Expert-Driven Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define key relationships based on business knowledge.\n",
    "- Manually set conditional probabilities using historical insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Validating Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intervention Analysis**: Compare pre/post-pandemic case trends to confirm step reduction patterns.\n",
    "- **Counterfactual Scenarios**: Simulate policy changes (e.g., \"What if triage was never removed?\").\n",
    "- **Model Performance**: Cross-check DBN results with alternative models (e.g., Granger Causality, GAMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Python implementation using `pgmpy` or `bnlearn`?\n",
    "- A feature selection analysis to refine input variables?\n",
    "- A causal graph visualization?\n"

Having said that the rate of investigations particularly for Health and Welfare cases levelled off after the pandemic.\n",

    "•\tThe gradual decline in Health and Welfare and combined concerns from 2016 is interesting because it also coincides with what I believe was an operational decision at that time to remove the triage process for LPA investigations. This had the immediate effect of increasing the number of concerns accepted for investigation, which can be seen in the attached charts, followed by a gradual decline.  \n"
