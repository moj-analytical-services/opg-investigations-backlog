    "    - It suggests that the downward trend in the investigations rate for Health and Welfare cases or where investigations have included both Health and Welfare AND Property and Finance concerns have been gradual since 2016 rather than a step reduction associated with the pandemic. Having said that the rate of investigations particularly for Health and Welfare cases levelled off after the pandemic.\n",
    "    - There isn’t any evidence of a gradual decline in Finance and Property cases, but instead the pattern that we have discussed before of a sustained stepped reduction following the pandemic.\n",
    "    - The gradual decline in Health and Welfare and combined concerns from 2016 is interesting because it also coincides with what I believe was an operational decision at that time to remove the triage process for LPA investigations. This had the immediate effect of increasing the number of concerns accepted for investigation, which can be seen in the attached charts, followed by a gradual decline.  \n"
